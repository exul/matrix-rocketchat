      Hi, I'm the Rocket.Chat application service

      You have to connect this room to a Rocket.Chat server. To do so you can either use an already connected server (if there is one) or connect to a new server.

      **Connect to a new server**

      Open the Administration section of your Rocket.Chat server, select Integrations --> New Integration --> Outgoing WebHook with the following settings:

      * Enabled: true
      * URLs: ${as_url}/rocketchat

      There is a Token which we will need for the connection, copy it and press Save Changes to create a webhook.

      Now you can connect the server by sending a message in this room:

      `connect rocketchaturl token rockatchat_server_id`

      The `rocketchaturl` is the URL where your Rocket.Chat server is running and `token` is the token from the webhook you just created.
      The `rocketchat_server_id` can be any alphanumeric string (including `_`) with a maximum length of ${max_rocketchat_server_id_length} characters. It will be part of the room aliases and user names for that server to uniquely identify them.
      *It is highly recommended that you use https to connect to your Rocket.Chat server.*

      A sample message could look like this:

      `connect https://chat.example.com z44cwkD86P5PmdkEv7nHX7KB my_id`

      **Already connected servers**

      ${server_list}

      To use an already connected server, you can use the Rocket.Chat URL in the list:

      `connect rocketchaturl`

      A sample message could look like this:

      `connect https://chat.example.com`
    login_instructions: |
      You are connected to ${rocketchat_url}.

      You have to login before you can use the application service, there are two ways to do that:

      1. Send a message in this room: `login rocketchatusername mysecret`
      **Warning**: This will store your password *unecrypted* in the database of your homeserver

      1. Login via curl: `curl ${as_url}/rocketchat/login -d '{"rocketchat_url": "${rocketchat_url}", "matrix_user_id": "${matrix_user_id}", "rocketchat_username": "ROCKETCHAT_USER", "password": "MYSECRET"}'`
    no_rocketchat_server_connected: "No Rocket.Chat server is connected yet."
    usage_instructions: |
      You are logged in.

      You are connected to ${rocketchat_url}.

      `list` Lists all public rooms from the Rocket.Chat server

      `bridge rocketchatroomnname` Bridge a Rocket.Chat room

      `unbridge rocketchatroomnname` Unbridge a Rocket.Chat room (messages are no longer forwarded)
    list_rocketchat_rooms: |
      Rooms are written in *italic* when you joined them on the Rocket.Chat server, you can `bridge` such a room.
